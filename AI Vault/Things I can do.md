- Go over the dataset and remove extraneous examples
- Read papers on few shot learning


Questions for Vivek
1. In a lot of few shot learning papers I see data augmentation as a common technique, how is this better than having similar versions of each image?
	My guess would be that the augmented images are actually less similar than the ones that I have in my dataset.
