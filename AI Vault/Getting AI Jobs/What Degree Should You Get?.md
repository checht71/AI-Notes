>[!abstract] TL;DR: YOU NEED AT LEAST A MASTER'S DEGREE. ML engineer is not a junior position. It is usually reserved for people with more experience. You can get a job with a BS, but it will pay nothing in comparison for the same amount of work.

As of 2023, colleges have not caught up to the AI revolution. This means that there is no specific major that will land you a job in AI: you can be a Computer Science, Computer Engineering or Data Science major, it doesn't matter. Your knowledge will come more from outside school than inside. That being said, having a degree will increase your pay significantly.

### Jobs in AI
There are a few positions which fall under the general umbrella of "artificial intelligence": data scientist, ai engineer


***The list below is simply a rule of thumb.*** Colleges have widely not caught up to the explosive progress in the ML field, and your skill will mostly come from your own experience outside of college, especially at the bachelor's level. Leverage your own talents as much as you leverage your degree. Ultimately someone with a bachelor's who has more relevant experience is more relevant that someone with a master's who has not.

## Bachelor's

A bachelor's degree will allow you to mostly work on the application side of artificial intelligence, creating AI systems that are pretty basic and fit into the already established science of your time. You take existing concepts, apply them to problems, then deploy the models.

## Master's
Master's will bridge the gap between research and application most likely, or allow you to get more pay for applied ML. You will be able to take existing models and modify them based on the underlying statistics and linear algebra. You do not have to conform to the built in functions of Tensorflow or Pytorch.

>[!tip] You do NOT have to get your master's in the same field that you got your bachelor's. You can go outside of the ECE field and go into computer science or another similar field.



## PhD
You will be most likely be doing research rather than working with applied ML. You will be diving deep into the probability and linear algebra side of Machine Learning. You will be the one developing the techniques that trickle down into the application side of things as they become convention. This is an exciting part of ML, but unless you work for FAANG, you will most likely not make as much money as a bachelor's degree in applied ML if you stay at a university and teach. You may even make _less_ money than your counterparts unless you go to a big tech company, since you will have to take up a university position and begin research.

## Management
I've read on the machine learning subreddit that getting some kind of degree or experience in management will most likely give you a bigger bang for your buck financially than a Phd. The problem is that your job becomes less about engineering and more about management the farther that you climb up the ladder.
