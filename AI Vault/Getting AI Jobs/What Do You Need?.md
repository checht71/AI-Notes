Due to the explosive increase in interest for AI over the past few years, as of 2023 it is not hard at all to get an AI job. One of my professors did not have a GitHub on his resume and still got a well paying job. That being said, you can still make yourself stand out by demonstrating your skills.

# What You Need:
# ==Soft Skills==
You need them!!!!!! This is the main thing that will make you stand out from other people. **KNOW HOW TO COMMUNICATE AND NETWORK**. People that are only half qualified for a job get the position because they have great communication and networking skills. Even great developers are extremely limited if they cannot work in teams and communicate their thoughts!! 


# What You Don't
#### You do NOT need to grind Leetcode
This is according to one of my professors who has a job in ML. During coding interviews, you will be required to approach a problem and explain your approach.
