1. Neural network in numpy
	shows a good knowledge of ML background and in depth understanding of the inner workings of ML.
2. Multi-type ensemble
	 Pick and AI problem and use multiple algorithms to classify it (ex. decision trees and KNNs and SVMs and linear classifiers and logarithmic classifiers). Create a multialogrithm enesemble from these and leverage their individual merits.
3. LLMS
	LLMs are really hot right now. Develop one.
