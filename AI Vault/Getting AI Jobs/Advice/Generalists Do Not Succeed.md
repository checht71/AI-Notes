Advice from Kyle Naddeo:

If you want to break into the field of AI, you should be highly specialized. 90% of the time you get a job, it is because they are looking for that *exact* thing that you specialize in. Find your niche. If you're a full stack developer, you know SQL, etc. you will only end up being subpar at these skills. Think about it: a smart company will not hire an all rounder who can only sort of do everything, they will hire multiple specialists who will work together to create something much better.

>[!tip] __TL;DR__
>Specialize. Generalists don't get hired. Find a niche and do it better than anyone else.
