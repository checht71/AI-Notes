This is just a bunch of advice that I've seen in online comments related to machine learning engineering.


### [1. MLE Degree and Salary](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/185y5wn/d_machine_learning_engineer_salary_increase/)
"I made over 100k in a low cost of living city roughly a month or so after graduating; the company is a fortune 100 in one of the lower paying industries. I have a BS in IT and masters in AI. I think that the masters is usually just to get your foot in the door since most data scientist and related positions have a graduate degree. If you already have a job in the field and consider yourself knowledgeable with the ML skill sets then I’m not sure a masters would help for most basic positions. I’d just make sure that your job duties lineup with jobs you might want in the future. Some companies may only hire people with graduate degrees for the field, and they definitely will pay more for them, but I imagine if you have a solid project history you’ll be fine in most cases.

If you don’t feel adequate on your knowledge to be high performing in the field, you could always self study or choose to get a graduate degree. If you want to go to the research side of things then you definitely will need a higher degree."

"I'm not in industry, but I can tell you that I made pretty much exactly your salary ($76k) as an intern when I was at the Masters level and doing my PhD. This was a non-FAANG company. I hope that helps to give you some idea."

### Other Advice:
>Used to screen resumes for small companies. Job "requirements" are more of a wish-list situation. Never let some unchecked boxes deter you from applying - you have no idea what the applicant pool is like. The biggest boon, especially at small companies, is someone who legitimately cares.

> Electrical Engineer. To you young people… YOU NEED TO CHANGE COMPANIES. Whenever you feel like you are 1) taking on new roles without your pay increasing significantly or 2) if you feel ready to take on new roles. You will never keep pace with inflation or get ahead at one employer.
