## AI Engineer
This is the most high paying out of the AI jobs. This position focuses more on deployment than on actually creating models. You can get this position with a bachelor's degree. You should know the basics of how most kinds of models are used and how to deploy them onto the web and edge devices. Most of your work comes down to selecting a model, training it, and deploying it. You are not doing much in the way of customizing an AI system or delving into the deep intricacies, you write an "AI prescription" for a problem.

## Data Scientist
This is one of the only positions in AI that there's actually a degree for (as of 2023). "Data scientist" is a broad term that a lot of jobs fit under: [data analyst](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-does-a-data-analyst-do-a-career-guide), [business intelligence analyst](https://www.coursera.org/articles/business-intelligence-analysts-what-they-are-and-how-to-become-one), statistician, and [data engineer](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-does-a-data-engineer-do-and-how-do-i-become-one).
Generally, data science focuses much more on probability and statistics and finding underlying patterns in data than actual engineering of systems. You will churn numbers to analyze statistics about a product or company and its performance.

## AI Researcher
This position may or may not be as high paying as an AI engineer. You will most likely be working for either a university or a tech company which has a vested interest in breaking ground (i.e. FAANG or OpenAI). You will be delving into the fundamentals of AI such as statistics and linear algebra. You will be developing new techniques to improve AI systems as a whole and push the field forward.

## AI Engineering Management
This is the most high paying and least technically involved of all the positions you could get. You will be managing a team of AI engineers. You won't really get into the nitty gritty of each problem, you will be telling other people what to do and making sure they do it. You should at least have a bachelor's in something computer related and some experience or a minor in management if you want to get this position.
