Tensorboard is a way of visualizing a model's training metrics within Tensorflow. It can give you tons of information: 
- Graphs of running loss, accuracy, etc.
- Data across multiple training runs
- Correlation between hyperparameters and accuracy in [[Keras Tuner]]
- Image visualizations
- Histograms & other graphs

### SummaryWriter
The SummaryWriter is the module that actually does the logging for Tensorboard.
