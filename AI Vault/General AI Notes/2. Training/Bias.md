## Why Include Bias?
The reason behind bias is very simple. We can explain it best using a graph and a linear classifier algorithm such as a #perceptron.

Above is a picture which depicts 2 classes split down the middle by a line. Notice how the line starts at the origin. If we want to change the y-intercept of this line, we must add a bias to the function.

The bias allows us to have functions which look like this. Not only can we change the direction of the line, we can move the line up and down as well. That's really it.
