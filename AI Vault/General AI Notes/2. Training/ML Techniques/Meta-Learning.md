Meta-Learning is a [[Few-Shot Learning]] technique in which generalized models are created which can be easily adapted to new tasks. Like [[Transfer Learning]], this approach is another way to combat [[Overfitting]] in small datasets.
While transfer learning focuses more on taking a specific model and retuning it for a specific task, meta-learning can retune itself without a training process.

"Designed to generalize learning strategies across tasks, allowing for rapid adaptation with minimal retraining. The goal is for the model to leverage its meta-knowledge to quickly adjust to new tasks."
