## Main Frameworks
The following frameworks are some of the most commonly used across all AI. Many of the models that you come across are going to be created or even deployed in some cases under these frameworks.
### TensorFlow
TensorFlow is best for beginners, but doesn't have great documentation when you start getting into the more complex stuff and it doesn't give you the complete control over your model and the training process like PyTorch.
### PyTorch
PyTorch is preferred by many more advanced Machine Learning Devs. It allows for a ton of customization with your model and training process, but that comes with an added layer of complexity that makes it a little difficult to learn even for those who have made models in TensorFlow.
### SciKit
I honestly don't know much about this one. Mostly it seems to be the choice for classic machine learning approaches which *do not* involve neural networks such as random forests and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). I don't see many tutorials on making a model purely in scikit, but I do see a lot of modules from scikit being implemented into PyTorch and TensorFlow models. Comp Sci majors love scikit for reasons unknown to me. If you use scikit, make sure that you are familiar with the `numpy` and `pandas` packages because you will be using them for data management instead of the built in methods of TensorFlow or PyTorch.
### Fast.ai
Fast.ai is a framework built on top of PyTorch that adds a layer of abstraction that makes it easier to code with. This one is gaining popularity as of 2024, but it has not caught up to the other frameworks.
### MxNet
It's a framework. That's literally all I know.
