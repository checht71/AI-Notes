Most of the computers that people use at home simply are not good enough to have the raw processing power needed to train AI models. In order to better utilize your time, you should use one of these cloud computing resources.

### 1. Google Colab
This is by far the easiest to use and most accessible cloud resource for you to use. It's also free and takes the form of a notebook. Just go to [research.colab.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/).

### 2. Lambda Cloud
This is a cloud computing resource that offers better GPUs but is a little bit more complicated to use. You can rent a stronger GPU for much cheaper than with Google because you can pay a few cents an hour instead of a $10 monthly subscription. You will need to use [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) and [[SSH for Cloud Computing|set up SSH]] in order to use this, but in my opinion it's worth it if you want to continue with ML in the long run.
