## Where is ML Headed?
[Jax](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3666812/what-is-google-jax-numpy-on-accelerators.html) and [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) by Google are supposed to replace other frameworks like Tensorflow.

As of 2023, python dominates the AI space. You should simply learn python if you want to get into AI. In the future, other languages such as julia may replace it because it can run natively on a GPU (no need for CUDA). You can also write using symbols to make beautiful math expressions (which isn't super useful but I personally like). As of now it's irrelevant and not widely used.

## Where are we Now?
As of 2021, the state of the art in machine learning is models being trained on massive, fixed datasets with supervised learning. This means an insane amount of labelled data.

As a problem becomes more complex, finding a massive dataset with examples that represent the problem well becomes exponentially harder.
