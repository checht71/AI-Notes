High Performance Computing (HPC) is when you take a bunch of computers and have them each work on the same task together.[^1] The only reason I wrote this article is so that you know this is a complete waste of time for machine learning. When you train a model, it is trained on a state of the art GPU that has no business being in a regular computer. HPCs are great for specific tasks, but training AI models simply isn't one of them. When you host a model in the cloud, you are actually doing the exact opposite of HPC. You are taking a single highly advanced server and making it run multiple virtual machines at once instead of merging a bunch of computers together into one server. Don't use HPC. Use [[Cloud Computing Overview|Cloud Computing]] instead.
