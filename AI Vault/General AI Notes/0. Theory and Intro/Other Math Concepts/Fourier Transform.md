The Fourier Transform is one of the most pivotal concepts within the realm of engineering. It takes a complex signal and breaks it down into a series of sine waves. This is insane. Mathematically this is like taking a cake that you have baked and turning it back into eggs, flour and milk.

Notice the complex looking signal in the red "time" box. This is what you would normally see. The Fourier Transform breaks this signal down into 3 sine waves. You can see their frequencies in the blue "frequency" box.

### Applications in Signal Processing:
"One of the most traditional and well-established applications of the Fourier Transform is in signal processing. It is used in tasks such as audio processing, image analysis, and data compression. For example, in audio processing, the Fourier Transform helps identify the various frequencies present in an audio signal, enabling tasks like speech recognition, music classification, and noise reduction."[^1]
### Applications in Machine Learning:
#### 1. Time Series Analysis
This is one of the most classic uses of the Fourier Transform: To analyze a time based signal and break it down for analysis. This application is one of the most broad as well. It applies to fields such as healthcare and weather detection. Anywhere you find a time based signal, the Fourier Series is applicable.
#### 2. Natural Language Processing
Believe it or not, you can treat a string of words like a discrete signal. Using the Fourier Transform on this signal, you can classify the sentiment and content of the text based on your analysis of the frequencies found in the text.
#### 3. Feature Engineering
Other data such as images can be converted into a series of signals using methods such as the [[Discrete Cosine Transform]]. By converting data into the frequency domain, it allows you to better capture some relevant features of the data that are difficult to capture in the time domain.
#### 4. [[Convolutional Networks]]
[[Convolutional Layers|Convolutional filters]] can use the Fourier transform to specialize in detecting frequency based components of images. This improves the overall performance of some neural networks.
#### 5. [[Data Augmentation]]
There are many different ways to augment data. Many of the ones we think of are cropping, rotation, or hue adjustment. One of the more interesting ways of augmenting an image is by altering its frequency components using the Fourier Transform[^1].
#### 6. Dimension Reduction
Some data comes in very high dimensions. Sometimes it is much better for humans to interpret and visualize this data if the amount of dimensions are reduced. The Fourier Transform has proven helpful in this application[^2]. Other methods of dimension reduction include [[t-SNE]] clustering.
