In order to remove sensitive info from your github repos that you have accidentally uploaded, you need `git filter repo`. You can install it with `pip install git-filter-repo`.

Once you have this installed, you should always create a new folder on your local system so that your work does not accidentally get deleted while using this tool. You are essentially deleting your backup when you use this, so be very careful.

Clone a fresh version of your repo into this new folder.
