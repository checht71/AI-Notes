> Lightning structures your PyTorch code so it can abstract the details of training. This makes AI research scalable and fast to iterate on.

The majority of the code is the exact same as normal PyTorch, the only difference is that the training loop has a few different lines of code and now there's built in functionality such as the TensorBoard logger.
