![[K Means Clustering.png|600]]

#### Here's the algorithm in a nutshell:
_Setup_
K is the amount of clusters you want to identify.
Randomly select K data points and uses them as centers for the first loop.
_Loop_
Measures distance between each point and the 3 initial clusters, sorts.
Finds the center of each cluster and uses it as the center for the next loop.

Each time a new center is picked and the algorithm loops, it hones in on specific portions of the data until it finds "the best sort".
