Logistic regression is a way of predicting a binary outcome using math. It yields a percent chance that the sample in question fits to one class or the other. In many cases, these percent chances are rounded up or down at the 50% mark to classify things. 
Activation functions such as the sigmoid curve are actually logistic regression algorithms.




Logistic regression can classify just about any kind of data. It is even used as one of the most basic forms of natural language processing, particularly in [text sentiment analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo4wDfuXT4k).
