Logistic regression is a way of predicting a binary outcome using math. It yields a percent chance that the sample in question fits to one class or the other. In many cases, these percent chances are rounded up or down at the 50% mark to classify things. 
Activation functions such as the sigmoid curve are actually logistic regression algorithms.
