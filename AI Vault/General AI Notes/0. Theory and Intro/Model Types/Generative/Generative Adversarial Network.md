A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is an old way of AI image generation. This method has been made largely obsolete, and has been replaced with diffusion methods. In many cases, GANs learn using unsupervised methods, but they can also learn using semi-supervised and supervised methods in some use cases.

## Applications
### Unsupervised
### Semi-Supervised
### Supervised
One of the few applications for Supervised Generative Adversarial Networks is augmented dataset generation. What this means is that you feed your GAN images with labels associated with them, then the GAN creates more images which fall under each label. This allows you to artificially create a larger dataset.
