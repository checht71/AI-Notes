Bentoctl is a depreciated library for bentoml where you can deploy it to any hosting framework you want: Azure, AWS, Lambda, etc.
The team behind BentoML is working on replacing this with the Bento Cloud, but as of 2024 this is in beta and there is a waiting list.

Here is the link on deploying Bentos to Azure:
