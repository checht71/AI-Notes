When we create our models, we often use data loaders in order to train and test our models. When we put them on a web app using Bento, it can be a little difficult to know exactly how to handle the pipelining. [This page](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/v1.1.11/reference/api_io_descriptors.html) will show you everything that you need to know about the supported datatypes.
The main types of data supported are numpy arrays, images, text, and pandas dataframes. You will need to take these as inputs and convert them to tensors if that is how your model handles inputs. So basically in order to run something in Bento you must take these input and then transform them using your PyTorch/TensorFlow code into the correct format for your model.
