Docker is a service that allows you to compartmentalize your programs so that they can run in server farms much more optimally. Docker images are called "containers". The idea is rather than having a single server instance host 1 app, a single server instance can host multiple containers at once. Each container has information about the program, endpoints and dependencies, so the server will be running virtual instances of your program based on this info.[^1]

> [!tldr] TL;DR
> Docker allows shit to run effectively on cloud computing servers.
