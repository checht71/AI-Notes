Azure contains a lot of prebuilt AI models for pretty much any AI application similar to hugging-face. 

## REST API
All azure AI services work much like other methods of deployment. In order to send and receive information to your model in the cloud, you have to send an HTTP request in JSON format. The response with the predictions will also be in JSON as well.

There are also Source Development Kits (SDKs) that abstract away some of the work that you have to do in REST APIs.
