FastAPI is a package that allows you to take your AI model or other program and make an online node with it. Users can send and receive data from this node. It's called an endpoint. You can then send and receive data to the node, run the program on it, and send back the results. This node is called an API, which stands for Application Programming Interface.

FastAPI allows you to work with [[HTTP Methods]] as well.
#### Path Parameters
Path parameters are things that you can add to the end of the URL too access a specific functionality of the API.
#### Query Parameters
Query parameters are parameters which are not specified in the URL. You can change these parameters by including a `?` in the URL and then specifying them afterwards.
