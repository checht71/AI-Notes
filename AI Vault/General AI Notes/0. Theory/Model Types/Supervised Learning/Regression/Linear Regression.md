## Overview
Regression is the relationship between 2 things, particularly how an independent variable affects a dependent variable.

"Any equation, that is a function of the dependent variables and a set of weights is called a regression function." [^1]

If you think about the equations that you used in physics and chemistry, a large majority of them describe this kind of relationship between two things. When it comes to neural networks, these relationships are often described using linear equations.
Ex:
$$ y = x_1 w_1 + x_2 w_2 + x_3 w_3...$$

Where $w$ represents the weights. The weights are learned during training by studying the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
