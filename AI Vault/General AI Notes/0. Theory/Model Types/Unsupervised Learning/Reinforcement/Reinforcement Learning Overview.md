Reinforcement learning is a form of unsupervised machine learning where the model, in this case often referred to as an *agent*, learns from interaction with an environment rather than a dataset. The model makes a decision, often referred to as a 'step', and the environment responds with a *state* and a *reward*. The model then selects its next step based on this feedback, and the cycle repeats.

Reinforcement learning is often associated with games, because they are easy and responsive environments to train models in. Many of the problems that you will find yourself using RL models on you will notice also feel like games.
