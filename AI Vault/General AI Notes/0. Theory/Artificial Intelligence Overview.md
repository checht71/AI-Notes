At it's core, every single AI is essentially just a prediction program. You take information that you want to have AI analyze for you and [[Creating Robust Datasets|create a dataset]]. This could be anything from images to raw data. You select an [[Convolutional Networks|architecture]] and train the model on your data so that it creates a representation of the data. Then you deploy your model and have it make predictions about outcomes based on the previous data that you fed it.

Training an AI is at its core just a minimization problem. You select a [[Model Evaluation|metric to evaluate your model]] so you can understand how good it is, and a [[Cost & Loss Functions|loss function]] so that your AI can understand which direction it needs to go in order to get better at predictions.
