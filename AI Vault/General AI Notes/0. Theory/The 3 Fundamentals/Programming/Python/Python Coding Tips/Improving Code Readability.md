## Dictionary of constants
If you are using a lot of repeated attributes such as the color of a button or text size in Tkinter, you can make a dictionary object in a seperate folder, import it to your main file, then just reference the dictionary once and it will pass in all of the attributes you want to an item. This is very similar to a styles guide.

Don't use magic numbers.

## Consistency
Use consistent indentations, name conventions, and overall style.

## Convention
Use coding convention (PEP 8) [[https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/]]

## Bake in Intent
Try to make your code almost read like english. If you have some sort of function, name it what it does. If you have a long line of code that does somthing, but it is not super clear to another person what it may do, put it in a function that describes it. It should be so that a person who does not even know how to code can read over your work and get some kind of an idea about what's going on. Include units in the names of your variables if applicable.

## Cut out the Fat
If you bake in your intent and make all of your functions and variable names super readable, you will never need a comment to explain what something is doing.
