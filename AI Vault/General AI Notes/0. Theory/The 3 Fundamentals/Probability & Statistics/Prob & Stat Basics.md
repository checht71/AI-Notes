# Sample Sets


# Three Axioms of Probability
These are the basic building blocks of probability and statistics. All of the other equations that you see are built upon these foundations, similar to Newton's Laws in Physics.

### Axiom 1:
For every event $A$, the probability of the event must be positive or 0.
$$Pr(A)\geq 0$$

### Axiom 2:
For the sample space $S$, the total probability is $1$.
$$Pr(S)=1$$

### Axiom 3:
The union of any disjointed events is equal to their sum.
$$Pr(A_1\bigcup A_2 \bigcup A_n...) = \sum A_n$$
