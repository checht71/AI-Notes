# Image Labelling Techniques
1. Semantic Segmentation
	The image is sectioned off into smaller portions.
2. Instance Segmentation
	Semantic segmentation, but every individual object has its own section.
3. Object Labelling
	Each individual object is its own 'entity'


# Important Questions:
### How will we collect more data once our data is labelled?
Ask Dr Mehta.


### How will we implement the COCO JSON file format into our project?
[TFDS CLI](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/add_dataset)
	TFDS CLI is a way to take existing datasets and reformat them so that they can be used in tensorflow.
