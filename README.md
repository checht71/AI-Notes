# Overview
This is a backup of all of the notes that I have created concerning aritifical intelligence. They were written in obsidian and I highly recommend you download it to view them.

These notes are split up into 5 parts:

## [Theory](https://github.com/checht71/AI-Notes/tree/main/AI%20Vault/General%20AI%20Notes/0.%20Theory)
This covers basic mathematical concepts which are the backbone of artificial intelligence. There are 3 big subjects that are key to to learning the mechanisms behind AI: programming, linear algebra, and prob & stat. These topics are covered in these notes. Another thing covered in this section is an overview of the different types of machine learning algorithms in use from CNNs to reinforcement learning algorithms & frameworks. This section also contains a [glossary](https://github.com/checht71/AI-Notes/blob/main/AI%20Vault/General%20AI%20Notes/0.%20Theory/Glossary.md) of AI terms.

## [Datasets](https://github.com/checht71/AI-Notes/tree/main/AI%20Vault/General%20AI%20Notes/1.%20Datasets)
This section focuses on how to create a custom dataset that you can train your model on. The main focus of this section is on image datasets.

## [Training](https://github.com/checht71/AI-Notes/tree/main/AI%20Vault/General%20AI%20Notes/2.%20Training)
This section focuses on all of the aspects of training an AI model. There are code examples for both PyTorch and Tensorflow. Topics like hyperparameter tuning are also covered.

## [Deployment](https://github.com/checht71/AI-Notes/tree/main/AI%20Vault/General%20AI%20Notes/3.%20Deployment)
This section focuses on deploying your AI model to production once it is trainied. It focuses on creating an API that you can call so that you can send data to your model running in the cloud and recieve predictions, as well as information on how to optimize your model for deployment using methods such as quantization.

## [Research](https://github.com/checht71/AI-Notes/tree/main/AI%20Vault/General%20AI%20Notes/4.%20Research)
This final section focuses on research areas which are being worked on to improve AI models. Topics such as few shot learning and continual learning are covered here.

Throughout theses chapters I have included almost every source that I've used, and included links to some textbooks that I think are spectacular for people trying to learn about AI at any skill level. I hope these notes help you!
